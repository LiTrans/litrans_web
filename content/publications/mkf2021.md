abstract: "Level of emotional arousal of one's body changes in response to external stimuli in an environment. Given the risks involved while crossing streets, particularly at unsignalized mid-block crosswalks, one can expect a change in the stress level of pedestrians. In this study, we investigate the levels and changes in pedestrian stress, under different road crossing scenarios in immersive virtual reality. To measure stress level of pedestrians, we used Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensors. To collect the required data for the model, Virtual Immersive Reality Environment (VIRE) tool is used, which enables us to measure participants' stress levels in a controlled environment. The results suggested that the density of vehicles has a positive effect, meaning as the density of vehicles increases, so does the stress level for pedestrians. It was noted that younger pedestrians have a lower amount of stress when crossing as compared to older pedestrians which have higher amounts of stress. Geometric variables have an impact on the stress level of pedestrians. The greater the number of lanes the greater the observed stress, which is due to the crossing distance increasing, while the walking speed remains the same."
