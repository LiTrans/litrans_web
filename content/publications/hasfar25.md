abstract: "Increasing use of private cars has caused several issues ranging from traffic congestion to air pollution. Although various studies confirmed the significant impact of urban form on public transportation demand, these studies are mainly limited to Global North or China. This study aims to address this gap and capture the nonlinear contributions of various elements of urban form in choosing public transportation mode in one of the developing countries considering spatial heterogeneity. For this purpose, by reading the previous studies, potentially effective elements of urban form were identified. Using data from a city in Iran, Middle East, random forest regression was developed as a powerful machine-learning method based on recent advances in related data-driven techniques. The proposed model achieved proper goodness of fit but, more importantly, allowed us to compare the impact of urban form on public transportation demand worldwide based on a game theoretic interpretability technique. We found that the directions of associations for most variables aligned with other studies in other parts of the world. However, there were several main variables whose directions of association differed at the origin and the destination, such as distance from the city center; moreover, some variablesâ€™ direction of association was opposite that of other studies, like distance to education land-use. Therefore, the effect of each variable on public transportation demand must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and based on origin-destination."
