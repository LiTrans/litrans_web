abstract: "This study explored the capacity characteristics of five long-term WZ configurations at a major signalized intersection in Toronto. In total, 1,766 cycles and 22,057 inter-vehicle headway observations were recorded using over 140 hours of real-time traffic videos. The saturation flow rate ranged from
1318.7 to 1767.3 pc/hr/ln across the study sites. Interestingly, the Highway Capacity Manual WZ model was found to significantly overestimate the traffic capacity at the study sites. The analysis assessed the hypothesis that the saturation headway is further compressed when long queues are present on site. The average saturation headway during oversaturated conditions was found to be shorter by 5 to 11% across the study sites as compared to undersaturated conditions. Other influential factors such as day versus night and late-merge were assessed. The saturation flow under daytime conditions was higher by 3 to 5% as compared to nighttimes. Vehicles merging late from the closed lanes had a shorter headway as compared to vehicles approaching from the open lane by around 8 to 10%. Probability distribution functions of the saturation headway were developed, the best-fit curve for all cases was found to be the three-parameter lognormal distribution. The study also developed multiple regression equations to estimate WZ capacity reduction induced by heavy vehicles for a wide range of heavy vehicle
percentages. On average, oversaturated conditions yielded a 5.4% additional flow reduction as compared to undersaturated conditions for the same HV%. Moreover, the impact of different snow conditions on the saturation flow was estimated. The fully slushy, partly slushy, and bare-and-wet snow categories resulted in headway elongation of 35.1 to 42%, 21.2 to 23.4%, and 6.2 to 12.6%, respectively. The study explains how the findings can assist transportation agencies and practitioners in improving the policies, practices, and guidelines related to WZ activities and planning."
