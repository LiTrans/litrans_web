### Virtual Immersive Reality Environment (VIRE)

##### Abstract
VIRE is a multi-player, multi-modal, dynamic digital twin that uses virtual reality for travel behaviour analysis. It is used to develop complex choice experiments for behavioural analysis as well as for human-in-the-loop training of automated vehicles.
