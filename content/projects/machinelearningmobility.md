### Restricted Boltzmann Machine based Multiple Discrete Continuous Model for very large datasets

##### Abstract

Efficient and robust machine learning frameworks for explaining latent behaviour are becoming more important with the increased use of very large scale multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) choice data in travel behaviour modelling.
In such type of data, there are various complex inter-dependencies because of the multiple unobserved heterogeneous population behaviour types.
Moreover, advanced utility based modelling techniques may not be able to capture the different facets of high-dimensional information and the estimation techniques used may not be able to manage such large data.
This paper propose a novel generative modelling methodology for MDC data based on a Restricted Boltzmann Machine framework. We consider a large scale regional travel survey which contains information on 624,845 individual trips.
Trip mode, purpose and distance measures are specifically considered in our case study. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated the applicability of the proposed method and could significantly improve the understanding of latent behaviour in MDC choice data.
