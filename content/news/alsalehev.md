The GBA is a public-private collaboration platform founded in 2017 at the World Economic Forum to help establish a sustainable battery value chain by 2030. It brings together 140+ leading international organizations, NGOs, industry actors, academics and multiple governments to align collectively in a pre-competitive approach, to drive systemic change along the entire value chain. The GBA was incubated by the World Economic Forum from 2017 until its estbalishment as an independent organisation incorporated in Belgium in 2022.


As part of Tareqâ€™s fellowship, he will contribute to the development of the "Battery Passport Wave 3.0" indicator framework and support the revision of the GHG Emissions Rulebook.


Tareq has been a PhD researcher at LiTrans since September 2022 under the supervision of Dr. Farooq. His research explores transportation sustainability, with a focus on the role of emerging technologies in shaping the future of mobility. In particular, he examines how to utilize and improve innovations such as electrification and artificial intelligence to support the transition toward more sustainable transportation systems.
