Dr. Alemtsehay Subhatu recently joined the [Bridging Divides program](https://www.torontomu.ca/bridging-divides/) at Toronto Metropolitan University as a Senior Research Associate. In this role, Dr. Alemtsehay will work with Prof. Anna Triandafyllidou. As a Senior Research Associate, she will work with the Place and Infrastructure theme and serve as a liaison between the central research and operations team and the theme's scientific co-leads. This work will focus on supporting research fundraising, identifying emerging research grants, and facilitating collaboration across thematic streams.


Dr. Alemtsehay has been working at LiTrans as a postdoctoral researcher supervised by Dr. Bilal Farooq from October 2023 to May 2025. During her Postdoc, the researcher focused on developing a holistic approach to migrant integration using the Ontology approach. After creating the holistic conceptual framework, her research work is further expanded using the System Dynamics Model, including the urban labour market, housing market, and infrastructure services from an immigrant and immigrant integration perspective, which is in progress.
