{{< figure src="/news/images/IMG_3917.jpg" width="75%" >}}

Congratulations to Melvin Wong on successfully defending his PhD thesis on August 12, 2019. Dr. Wong completed his undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) in 2015. The same year he was admitted to the Ph.D. program. His thesis developed interpretable generative machine learning models for travel demand analysis.
