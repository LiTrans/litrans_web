Nadia Bisek was nationally selected to participate in the 2025 Canadian Urban Transit Association (CUTA) Young Leaders Summit, a premier youth conference dedicated to cultivating the next generation of urban mobility and transit professionals. Hosted in Montreal, the summit brought together emerging leaders from across Canada to engage in critical discussions on the future of transit, sustainability, and inclusive urban design.

Over three intensive days, participants attended thought-provoking presentations from industry experts and contributed to hands-on collaborative sessions. Nadia worked alongside other young professionals to develop and present an innovative Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) proposal to a panel of transit leaders. In addition, Nadia built valuable professional connections with practitioners specializing in on-demand transit—insights that will directly inform her ongoing research into sustainable and accessible mobility systems. A highlight of her experience included an exclusive technical tour of the EXO Pointe-Sainte-Charles Maintenance Centre, offering a behind-the-scenes perspective on transit operations and maintenance at scale. Motivated by the innovation and collaboration demonstrated at the summit, Nadia is applying her new knowledge to advance her research on innovative transit solutions across Canada.
