The [Queen Elizabeth II Graduate Scholarship in Science and Technology (QEII-GSST)](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019236.html) is a prestigious award that recognizes graduate students in Ontario for outstanding academic achievement and research excellence. For the 2025–2026 academic year, Bara Rababah, a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University’s Laboratory of Innovations in Transportation (LiTrans), has been awarded the QEII-GSST.

Bara's research focuses on pedestrian–vehicle interactions in immersive virtual reality environments, especially in evaluating safety within mixed traffic conditions involving both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. His work uses advanced data analysis methods including machine learning techniques to study safety indicators such as time-to-collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET), waiting time, and headway. His work was recently accepted at the [IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC 2025)](https://ieee-itsc.org/2025/) in Australia.

This recognition highlights Bara's contributions to advancing research in transportation safety, behavioural modelling, and emerging vehicle technologies, supporting his goals towards shaping safer and smarter urban mobility systems.
