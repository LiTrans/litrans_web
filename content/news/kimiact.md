Dr. Kimia Kamal has recently joined Canadian Tire Corporation as a Senior Data Scientist. In her role, Dr. Kamal will focus on advancing retail and customer behaviour analytics by developing robust machine learning models, building causal inference frameworks, and performing advanced customer and program analytics. Her expertise will contribute to delivering advanced data-driven insights that support the strategic goals of the Canadian Tire retail organization.


Dr. Kamal worked at LiTrans as a PhD student from January 2021 to December 2024 under the supervision of Dr. Bilal Farooq and, since then, has worked at LiTrans as a Postdoctoral Researcher. Her doctoral research centred on integrating deep neural networks with traditional statistical models, addressing the limitations of machine learning algorithms, and applying causal inference modelling for policy evaluation. Specifically, she established advanced econometric and data-driven behavioural models to analyze pedestrian behaviour in the presence of autonomous behaviours.
