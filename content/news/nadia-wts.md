Nadia Bisek was selected as one of this year’s [WTS Toronto Area Chapter](https://www.wtsinternational.org/chapters/toronto) Scholarship recipients, an award recognizing students who demonstrate meaningful involvement and a strong commitment to advancing gender diversity in the transportation industry. During her undergraduate studies, she took on leadership roles in advocacy and contributed to transportation projects that sparked her passion for accessible, innovative transit solutions. Now, as a master’s student, she continues to build on this foundation through her research on on-demand transit.


Nadia received her scholarship at the WTS Toronto Chapter Annual Dinner, where she was inspired by the many accomplished women shaping the future of transportation. Grateful for the mentorship and networking opportunities the scholarship offers, she looks forward to contributing to the industry and hopes to one day pay it forward by supporting the next generation of women in transportation.
