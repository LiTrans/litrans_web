**About the Project**

Work zones on highways impose contraction in the available roadway space creating adverse traffic mobility and safety impacts. On the other hand, new technologies have made it possible to collect and manage smart traffic data by deploying smart traffic sensors and cameras. This research project explored new techniques for managing traffic at highway work zone locations using smart systems, smart data, and smart vehicles. The project included three main studies or themes as outlined below and supported by links guiding to corresponding papers and presentations.
