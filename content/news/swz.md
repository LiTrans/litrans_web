**About the Project**

Work zones on highways impose contraction in the available roadway space creating adverse traffic mobility and safety impacts. On the other hand, new technologies have made it possible to collect and manage smart traffic data by deploying smart traffic sensors and cameras. This research project explored new techniques for managing traffic at highway work zone locations using smart systems, smart data, and smart vehicles. The project included three main studies or themes as outlined below and supported by links guiding to corresponding papers and presentations.

**About the Host and Partners**

This project extended over two years starting in February 2020 and was hosted at Laboratory of Innovations in Transportation (LiTrans), Department of Civil Engineering, Ryerson University under the supervision of Dr. Bilal Farooq. The project was awarded the [Mitacs Elevate program grant](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/elevate), which was funded by the Government of Canada and [Lazaret Capital Inc.](http://www.lazaretcapital.ca/) Several industrial partners assisted and supported this research project including Lazaret Capital (funding, project management), [Stinson ITS](https://stinsonits.ca/) (data access support, networking), and [Safe Roads Engineering](https://www.saferoadseng.com/) (technical support, supervision).
