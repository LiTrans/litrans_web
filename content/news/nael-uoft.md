Dr. Nael Alsaleh worked at LiTrans as a PhD student from September 2019 to December 2022. Throughout his doctoral studies, Dr. Alsaleh focused primarily on investigating different aspects of on-demand transit (ODT) systems in the context of low-density areas. In particular, he examined travel demand patterns, established travel demand models, and evaluated the sustainability of several designs as well as identified demand-switching points between them. In January 2023, Dr. Alsaleh joined the [Mobility Network](https://www.mobilitynetwork.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow in the field of electric and autonomous vehicle planning. In his new role, Dr. Alsaleh will work with [Professor Eric Miller](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/eric-miller/) to investigate the potential influence of various zero-occupant vehicle operating strategies on network congestion, the environment, and parking demand. This research project is intended to assist the [City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/) in developing its Automated Vehicles Tactical Plan and upcoming Micromobility Strategy.
