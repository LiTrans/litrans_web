Throughout the Ontario Graduate Scholarship program (OGS), the province offers merit-based scholarships every year to graduate students from all academic disciplines. There are only a limited number of scholarships available to international students, making it a highly competitive scholarship. On April 28, 2022, Nael Alsaleh was awarded the international Ontario Graduate Scholarship for the upcoming 2022-2023 academic year in recognition of the outstanding academic, research, and leadership achievements. Nael joined LiTrans in September 2019 to pursue his PhD studies, where his research interests include shared on-demand mobility services, connected and autonomous vehicles, transportation systems simulation, and on-demand goods delivery.
