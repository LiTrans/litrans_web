# Title
The Integration of IoT and Blockchain as the next game-changer in the digital transformation of supply chains and Scalability Analysis

# Abstract
Despite a huge investment in supply chain management software and digital infrastructures at company levels, most shippers and freight actors possess limited visibility into their shipments across the supply chain. This is partially due to a lack of horizontal and vertical integration among supply chain actors. Information is considered a valuable asset in the logistics and international trade industry and businesses are usually afraid of losing their competitiveness in the market by revealing information about their transport tasks. Lack of data exchange about shipments makes it difficult to quantify the inefficiencies and to prove the origins and provenance of goods, creating opportunities for fraud and increasing costs to manage compliance with specifications and regulatory requirements. The integration of Blockchain and IoT presents a tremendous opportunity to allow a more efficient, transparent and trustworthy flow of transactions between companies and individuals by removing the middleman and cutting out the costs, time-lapses, and inter-party lack of trust, while also maintaining the privacy, immutability and business data confidentiality. Blockchain characteristics can assist business structures like supply chain and shared logistics platforms, which involve many parties that need trust, transparency, as well as efficiency in inter-party transactions, contracting, and data management.
