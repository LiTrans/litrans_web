Dr. Mehdi Meshkani worked at LiTrans as a PhD student from May 2018 to July 2022. Mehdi's research mainly focused on the simulation and optimization of on-demand mobility systems. In particular, he worked on the matching problem in on-demand shared ride-hailing services, where he developed various types of matching algorithms that could deliver high-level of service while being scalable in large-scale instances. In January 2023, Dr. Meshkani joined the [Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering (CIISE)](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/info-systems-eng.html) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) as a Research Fellow in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. In his new role, Dr. Meshkani will be working with [Dr. Zachary Patterson](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/zachary-patterson.html) and [Dr. Nizar Bouguila](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/nizar-bouguila.html) on Micro Transit Demand Management (microTDM) project, in close collaboration with [BusPas inc.](https://buspas.com/en/), to bring together data-driven optimization, ubiquitous computing, and machine learning techniques to address the new challenges of public transit systems.
