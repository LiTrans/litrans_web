Dr. Muhammad Sajjad Ansar recently joined the transportation and land use planning research laboratory (TransForm lab) at the School of Urban and Regional Planning, TMU as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow in the field of active transportation infrastructure and travel behaviour. In his new role, Dr. Ansar will work with Professor Raktim Mitra and City of Toronto to identify and develop the reliable estimates for the GHG emissions impacts of existing and future cycling infrastructure. This research project is intended to assist the City of Toronto in measuring the GHG impacts directly resulting from the installation of cycling infrastructure.

Dr. Ansar worked at LiTrans as a PhD student from September 2020 to May 2024. Throughout his doctoral studies, Dr. Ansar focused primarily on modelling different driver behavioural aspects in the context of automated vehicles and mixed traffic. In particular, he used Virtual Reality (VR) setup, established advanced econometrics and data-driven models, and evaluated the shared control in conditional automated vehicles.
