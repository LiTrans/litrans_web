# Cybersecurity and Privacy Issues in Emerging Mobility Technologies and Services
#### Special Session at IEEE ITS Conference 2019, Auckland, New Zealand, 27-30 October
New mobility technologies and services are rapidly changing our travel habits. A large amount of personal data is generated while using these services. Nowadays, most of our mobility information is stored and processed online, while service providers are aware of sensitive and personal information that need to be protected. Nevertheless, in recent years many security breaches have occurred as well as incidences where companies misused the personal information. In 2015 a group of civic hackers deciphered and exposed the unstandardized bus system location data of Baltimore. In 2016 the San Francisco transit was hacked to give free access to commuters. During the same year, information of 57 million Uber customers and drivers were leaked. With the emergence of connected, automated, and shared vehicles cybersecurity and privacy issues are expected to become more frequent and challenging. Various governments have started to develop regulations related to cybersecurity and privacy. One such example is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) proposed by European Union (EU). Although the GDPR is only valid in the EU, it is still expected to push multinational companies to be more transparent on how they manage peopleâ€™s private information.

To address cybersecurity and privacy issues in emerging mobility technologies and services and how they could be built upon privacy principles and regulations (e.g. GDPR), a special session is organized at the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC 2019). It covers a range of related methodological issues and applications. In particular we invite original research contributions to address following or relevant issues:

- Privacy and cybersecurity issues arising from data sharing in connected, automated and shared vehicles environment
- Adversarial models, abstractions, and analyses for connected, automated and shared vehicles environment
- Methodologies and use cases for privacy techniques (e.g. K-anonymity, differential privacy, etc.) in mobility related location-based services
- Trade-offs related to utility and protection in location-based services using privacy preserving techniques
- New cybersecurity schemes and models (e.g. blockchain) for data-sharing and vehicle-sharing services
- Decentralized transportation services and cybersecurity and privacy issues related to them
- Design and implementation of IoT mobility devices with privacy as the directive axis
- Adversarial models, abstractions, and analyses for open data and associated anonymization techniques
- New methods for open data that guarantee privacy
- Privacy-aware centralized as well as distributed machine learning on mobility data

## Submission Instructions
When you submit your paper, please select the Special Session Code: <b>u9we1</b>. The deadline for submission is March 31, 2019. Note that the page limit for IEEE ITSC is six (6). For details, please refer to the conference CFP page: https://www.itsc2019.org/call-for-papers. Given the importance and timeliness of the topic, we will also suggest a special issue in IEEE Transactions on ITS, where selected papers from this special session will be invited to submit a full paper.
