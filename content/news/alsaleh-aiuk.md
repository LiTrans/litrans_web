In August 2023, Dr. Nael Alsaleh joined the [School of Engineering and Computing](https://www.aiu.edu.kw/schools/212757) at the [American International University (AIU) in Kuwait](https://www.aiu.edu.kw/) as an Assistant Professor. AIU was founded in 2019 and has rapidly evolved into a distinguished institution committed to providing high-quality education to local and Middle Eastern students, as well as actively participating in cutting-edge research within the community. The School of Engineering and Computing at AIU offers several Bachelor's degree programs, including Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Computer Science. As part of his new role, Dr. Alsaleh will teach undergraduate courses, conduct independent research on sustainable transport systems, mentor and advise students, and actively participate in university and community service activities. Dr. Alsaleh's journey at AIU is a continuation of his academic pursuit that began when he joined LiTrans as a PhD student in September 2019 under the supervision of [Professor Bilal Farooq](https://litrans.ca/team/farooq-b/). During his doctoral studies, he worked on various emerging on-demand transit projects with leading transportation service providers. His dissertation focused on exploring network designs, developing demand models, and evaluating the sustainability of on-demand public transit systems. Following his graduation in December 2022, Dr. Alsaleh engaged in postdoctoral research at the [Mobility Network](https://www.mobilitynetwork.utoronto.ca/people/#pdfs) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) under the supervision of [Professor Eric Miller](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/eric-miller/).
